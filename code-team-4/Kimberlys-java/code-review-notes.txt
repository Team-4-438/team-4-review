    Structure:      - Code seems to be about as consise and you could make it great job
                    - I really like the use of teh switch statement great idea
                    - great object oriented implementation


    fucntionality:  - Meets the test cases requirements and functioned great for me in vscode and was easy to use 

    Comments:       - I like the way you used comments to divide each section
                    - A few more comments in eachs section would be helpful for breaking down exactly what logic each chunk of code
                      is responsible for in the menu otehrwise great.
                    - you made the code easy to navigate, kept it short and simple, and made it look easy(and made it hard for me to find critiques)
                      great job!
