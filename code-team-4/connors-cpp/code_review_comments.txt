    Structure:      - Everything is well organized and well labeled, making looking through the 
                      files easier.
                    - Great use of header files for the implementation!

    Functionality:  - It took a second to figure out how to run the code but otherwise easy to use.
                    - Met all of the test cases and functioned well.
    
    Comments:       - Great use of comments throughout to explain your process.
                    - The code was easy to read through and understand.
